Some components are more complex\nthan others but you should cover each topic included in these templates.\n\n### Usage template: for components with one variant\n\nThe usage template helps describe when to use a component and how it works. You\ncan see this template in use for components with only one variant:\n[Accordion](/components/accordion/usage) and\n[Checkbox](/components/checkbox/usage).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Component name\ndescription: Explains what the component is in one or two sentences.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n<!-- Explains what the component is in one or two sentences. -->\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Behaviors</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Modifiers</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\n<!--\nInclude a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the component and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure. The header title give the user a high level overview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.*\n-->\n\n### When to use\n\n<!--\nInclude examples for when to use this component and how it addresses the use case / solves a problem for the user.\n\nExample:\n\n*Dropdowns can be used in forms on full pages, in modals, or on side panels. The dropdown component is used to filter or sort contents on a page. It is a stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.*\n-->\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\n<!--\nIf there are two similar components that are used for different use cases, spell that out here and explain which component to use for each use case.\n\nExample:\n\n*It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two or fewer options to choose from. In this case, use a radio button group instead.*\n-->\n\n## Live demo\n\n<!--Include component demo here.-->\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<!--The anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.\n\nSee [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an example.-->\n\n### Sizing (optional)\n\n<!--List out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case. Other topics that may be covered here include considerations around maximum heights, maximum widths, and responsive resizing.\n\nExample:\n\n*There are four responsive modal sizes: xs, small, default, large. Choose a size that works best for the amount of modal content you have. Modals with short messages should use a xs or small modal to avoid long single lines; for complex components, like data table the default or large modal will be more accommodating.*\n-->\n\n### Alignment (optional)\n\n<!--\nConsider the relationship with other items that are the same. How do they sit in groups? What is their juxtaposition. For example:\n\n- Checkbox, radio button—what is their relationship horizontally and vertically?\n- Notifications—how do they stack?\n- Button—what happens when there's more than one?\n\nWe have some alignment content in the Structure section of the Style tab, so consider the relationship between the two tabs and include a cross-reference if necessary.\n\nExample:\n\n*Inside of a modal, body copy, including titles, have a 20% margin-right. However, form inputs and other components expand the full width of a modal window.*\n-->\n\n### Placement\n\n<!--\nDiscuss placement of the component in a broader context, that is:\n\n- alongside other components\n- within the grid\n\nYou may want to include a link here to the Structure section of the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*Accordions can be placed with main page content or placed inside of a container such as a side panel or tile. When placing an accordion on the 2x Grid the indented title aligns to the grid columns and the top and bottom borders hang in the gutter.*\n-->\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n<!--\nIdentify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, links. Use H4s for the element names and provide guidelines underneath for each element.\n\nBriefly explain any particular rules such as phrase structure, word limits, and character limits. Where there's more than one rule, use bullets to list out the multiple rules for ease of reading. If necessary, refer out to main content guidelines for more detailed information, for example, capitalization, or recommended action labels.\n\nSee [Checkbox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/usage#content) and [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#content) for examples.\n-->\n\n### Overflow content\n\n<!--\nExplain how overflow content should be handled.\n\nExample:\n\n*When the accordion content is longer than the viewport the whole accordion should vertically scroll. Content should not scroll inside of an individual panel. Content should never scroll horizontally in an accordion.*\n-->\n\n### Further guidance\n\n<!--\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's [content guidelines]([https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)).\n-->\n\n## Behaviors\n\n<!--\nDetermine which component behaviors apply to your component, and include from the following sections as needed.\n-->\n\n### States\n\n<!--\nIf including any information on this topic, include the following line:\n\nFor detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component has two main states: collapsed and expanded. The chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.*\n-->\n\n### Interactions\n\n<!--\nInclude all possible interactions with the component, including:\n\n- Mouse\n- Keyboard\n- Screen readers\n\nSee [Accordion](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage#interactions) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Validation\n\n<!--\nInclude any guidelines for data validation and accompanying messaging. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#validation-and-errors) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Responsive behavior\n\n<!--\nInclude details about how the component should behave in responsive situations.\n-->\n\n### Default selection\n\n<!--\nCover guidance around default settings and provide rationale. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#default-values) and [Radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/usage/#default-selection) for examples.\n-->\n\n### Clickable areas\n\n<!--\nProvide details about the clickable areas of the component.\n-->\n\n### Loading\n\n<!--\nIf applicable, use this section to cross reference to the specific loading type in the [Loading component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern) and/or the [Loading pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern/).\n-->\n\n## Modifiers\n\n<!--\nThe modifiers section shows different ways of styling the component. Here are some examples:\n\n- adding an icon to a [button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#variations)\n- adding a button to a [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#anatomy)\n- styling a dropdown to appear inline with other content\n- using high and low contrast styles for [notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)\n- using a \"light\" variant in a [text input](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/code)\n-->\n\n## Related\n\n<!--\nDid you reference other components or patterns? List them here.\n\nIf necessary, clarify any differences between this component and related components.\n-->\n\n## References\n\n<!--\nInclude any research, citations, books or articles that you found helpful.\n-->\n\n## Feedback\n\n<!--Include a request for feedback here.-->\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n### Usage template: for components with multiple variants\n\nUse this template for documenting components that have multiple types or\nvariants. You can see this template in use for\n[Dropdown](/components/dropdown/usage), [Modal](/components/modal/usage), and\n[Notification](/components/notification/usage).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Component name\ndescription: Explains what the component is in one or two sentences.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n<!-- Explains what the component is in one or two sentences. -->\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Universal behaviors</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Component type\nname</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Modifiers</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\n<!--\nInclude a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the component and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.\n-->\n\n### When to use\n\n<!--\nInclude examples for when to use this component and how it addresses the use case / solves a problem for the user.\n\n*Use a dialog to request information that is preventing the system from continuing a user-initiated process.*\n-->\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\n<!--\nIf there are two similar components that are used for different use cases, spell that out here and explain which component to use for each use case.\n\nExample:\n\n*Consider using a select dropdown if most of your experience is form based or frequently used on mobile platforms. The native select works more easily with a native form when submitting data and is also easier to use on a mobile platform.*\n-->\n\n### Types\n\n<!--\nTypes are different variations of the component with significant visual or interaction differences, for example, primary button vs. secondary button vs. ghost button. Minor visual differences, such as button height, should be placed under modifiers.\n\nInclude a table with types of components and their purpose. Include links on the type names to the types sections below. See [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#passive-modal) for an example.\n-->\n\n## Live demo\n\n<!--\nInclude live demo here.\n-->\n\n## Formatting\n\n<!--\n### Anatomy\n\nThe anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.\n\nSee [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Sizing (optional)\n\n<!--\nList out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case.

Forms can be placed on a full page, in a modal or in a side panel. A checkbox can also be used for agreeing to terms and conditions or to filter information.*\n-->\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n<!--\nIdentify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, body copy, links.

The content should visibly fade at the end of the modal body area to indicate there is additional content out of view.*\n-->\n\n### Further guidance\n\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's\n[content guidelines](<[https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)>).\n\n## Universal behaviors\n\n<!--\nIf there are any *universal* behaviors that apply to all types listed in the types table above, include them here. For example, the Modal component has a heading here for \"Trap focus\" as this applies to all modal types.\n\nWhere behaviors are *unique* to each type of component, include them in the next section which goes into detail about each type.\n\nInclude the following line to introduce the universal behaviors:\n\nExample:\n\n*The behaviors listed in this section are universal across all of the types.

You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.\n\nThe following table shows an example from [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style).\n-->\n\n| Element | Property      | Color token        |\n| ------- | ------------- | ------------------ |\n| Title   | color         | `$text-primary`    |\n| Content | color         | `$text-primary`    |\n| Icon    | fill          | `$icon-primary`    |\n| Header  | border-top    | `$border-subtle`\\* |\n|         | background    | Transparent        |\n| Panel   | border-bottom | `$border-subtle`\\* |\n|         | background    | Transparent        |\n\n<Caption>\n  * Denotes a contextual color token that will change values based on the layer\n  it is placed on.\n</Caption>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![enabled state](images/accordion-style-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Interactive state color\n\n<!--\nUse a table to document properties and color tokens for interactive states. Begin the table with the State column, not the Element column; this helps users scan faster and better reference accompanying images, which are also organized by state. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.\n\nYou may also choose to include images or tabs to illustrate variants.\n\nThe following table shows an example from [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style).\n-->\n\n| State    | Element | Property   | Color token        |\n| -------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------ |\n| Hover    | Header  | background | `$layer-hover`\\*   |\n| Focus    | Header  | border     | `$focus`           |\n| Disabled | Header  | border-top | `$border-subtle`\\* |\n|          | Title   | background | `$text-disabled`   |\n|          | Icon    | fill       | `$icon-disabled`   |\n\n<Caption>\n  * Denotes a contextual color token that will change values based on the layer\n  it is placed on.\n</Caption>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Default\">\n\n![default accordion alignment interactive states](images/accordion-style-2.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Flush\">\n\n![flush accordion alignment interactive states](images/accordion-style-3.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Typography\n\n<!--\nBegin this section with any brief content guidelines. Link out to additional guidelines if needed.\n\nThen, use a table to document font-size, font-weight, and type tokens in this section. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.\n\nThe following table shows an example from [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style).\n-->\n\nAll accordion titles are set in sentence case. See the accordion\n[content guidelines](/components/accordion/usage#content) for more details.\n\n| Element | Font-size (px/rem) | Font-weight   | Type token |\n| ------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ---------- |\n| Title   | 14 / 0.875         | Regular / 400 | `$body-01` |\n| Content | 14 / 0.875         | Regular / 400 | `$body-01` |\n\n## Structure\n\n<!--\nBegin the structure section with a table to document states, spacing, and any other component-specific configurations. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.\n\nAdd supporting images to this section, with at least one image showing structure and another showing spacing measurements. Images should be accompanied by a descriptive caption and relate to the spec charts. Note we use the `image--fixed` markdown component in the Structure section to maintain size accuracy.\n\nVariants: You may need to provide additional specs for component variants like default versus flush alignment. For each variant, make a new h3 section and give it a name. The following are example pairs of section headers:\n\nDefault style text area structure\nFluid style text area structure\n\nDefault style text input structure\nFluid style text input structure\n\nDefault alignment structure\nFlush alignment structure\n\nModifiers: If you need to document additional ways of styling a component, add h3 sections under Structure as needed. Here are some example cases where a modifier section has been added:\n\n- adding an icon to a [button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#variations)\n- adding a button to a [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#anatomy)\n- using high and low contrast styles for [notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)\n\nThe following content shows example documentation from [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style), which has no variants and therefore does not need any h3 headers.\n-->\n\n| Element | Property    | px/rem   | Spacing token |\n| ------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |\n| Header  | height      | 40 / 2.5 | –             |\n| Item    | border-top  | 1        | –             |\n| Title   | margin-left | 16 / 1   | `$spacing-05` |\n\n<div className=\"image--fixed\">\n\n![Structure measurements for default accordion alignment](images/accordion-style-4.png)\n\n</div>\n\n<Caption>\n  Structure measurements for default accordion alignment. | px / rem\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n<div className=\"image--fixed\">\n\n![Spacing measurements for default accordion alignment](images/accordion-style-5.png)\n\n</div>\n\n<Caption>\n  Spacing measurements for default accordion alignment. | px / rem\n</Caption>\n\n## Size\n\n<!--\nIn the size section, provide a table of component size names and height. Be sure to cross-link this to the size section in the usage tab, which is where you should provide guidance about how to choose the best size for a given use case.\n\nExample: The following table shows an example from [Button](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/style).\n-->\n\nThere are six button sizes: small, medium, large productive, large expressive,\nextra large, and 2XL. The large expressive button is used in editorial and\ndigital marketing experiences.

The Breadcrumb component accepts a list of BreadcrumbItem components as children and each BreadcrumbItem is responsible for displaying the page links in the hierarchy.\n-->\n\n### Skeleton\n\n<!--\nInclude which component/s to use for the skeleton state and why it might be useful.\n\nExample:\n\n*You can use the BreadcrumbSkeleton component to render a skeleton variant of an breadcrumb. This is useful to display while content in your breadcrumb is being fetched from an external resource like an API.*\n-->\n\n## [Use case, for example, Skeleton state or Sorting]\n\n<!--\nEach use-case of this component becomes its own section. For example,\nif an accordion had a skeleton then you would name this section Skeleton.\n\nIf the component had a specific piece of functionality or behavior, like\nhow you can sort with a Data Table, then Sorting would be the name of this\nsection.\n\nThis section should include an explainer for the use-case and when to use it,\nalong with a code snippet that someone could bring into their project.\n-->\n\n## Component API\n\n### [Component name] props\n\n| Prop        | Type     | Required | Default | Description |\n| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| `className` | `string` | –        | –       | –           |\n\n<!--\n* Only specific required as `true`, if it's false you don't need to indicate that\n* Specify the default value if applicable\n* Provide a description if applicable\n* Annotate the type using TypeScript type annotations\n* Empty cells should be filled with en dashes (–)\n* Table should be sorted in alphabetical order\n-->\n\n#### [Component name][prop name]\n\n<!--\nUsed to clarify prop usage, provide additional info or snippets\n-->\n\n## References\n\n<!--\nA place for references, links, or a way clarify points made earlier\nin the documentation.\n-->\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n### Accessibility template\n\nThe accessibility template helps designers and developers ensure components are\naccessible. The published information helps users understand all the\naccessibility considerations that are baked into Carbon. Refer to our guidance\non creating the\n[keyboard interaction visuals](https://github.com/hiraaeth/component-contribution-accessibility/wiki/High-fidelity-keyboard-interaction-visuals).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Component name (you won't need to write this)\ndescription: Component description (you won't need to write this)\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n<!--\nThere are 2 stock page descriptions.\nChoose the first example if designers need to include annotations in their wireframes to make the component accessible. Choose the second if the component is accessible without additional design decisions.\n** If example 2 is used, the Design recommendations section and its anchor link should be removed.\n\nExample 1:\nDesign annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the\nstandard [component_name] component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.\n\nExample 2:\nNo accessibility annotations are needed for [component_name]s, but keep these considerations in\nmind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom component.\n-->\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>What Carbon provides</AnchorLink>\n  <!--\n  Only include Design recommendations if there are actually tasks for a designer to do\n  -->\n  <AnchorLink>Design recommendations</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Development considerations</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## What Carbon provides\n\nCarbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of\nblind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many\nother accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.\n\n### Keyboard interaction\n\n<!--\nThis keyboard section introduction text can give details of keyboard operation. For actionable components, begin by talking about the navigation via the tab stop, then discuss common interactions keys. For components with subcomponents, unless there is little interaction for the subcomponent, consider splitting the subcomponent considerations into a separate paragraph, separated by an illustration. Where operation is more complicated, separate headings for Keyboard navigation and Keyboard interaction can exist.Keyboard keys should be referred to with code styling.\n\nExample 1:\n-->\n\nEach accordion is a tab stop. `Space` or `Enter` keys expand or collapse\naccordions, which are collapsed by default. Interactive elements within expanded\naccordions integrate into the tab order automatically.\n\n<!--\nExample 2:\nEach page link in the breadcrumb is reached by `Tab` and activated by `Enter`. The current\npage, if listed in the breadcrumb, is not a link. If the breadcrumb is truncated, the ellipsis button\nfor the overflow menu is in the tab order. See [overflow menu]((https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/overflow-menu/usage/)) for details on its keyboard operation\n-->\n\n<!--\n**Images**\nUse one image to document keyboard navigation. If the component has limited operation functionality, it may also be incorporated in the same image. Otherwise, the operation should be dealt with in a separate image.\nNormally these images go across 8 columns.\nimages should follow the naming convention (component_name-accessibility-1.png\nThe ALT text text for the first image can be fairly generic, since the image is just restating information in the prior paragraph.\nThe caption should likewise summarize something already described in the preceding paragraph. No new information should be given in the caption. Due to technology constraints, keystroke names in the captions are not given any markdown styling.\nExample:\n![example of breadcrumb keyboard interaction](images/breadcrumb-accessibility-1.png)\n<Caption>\n  The breadcrumb's links are reached by Tab and activated by Enter.\n</Caption>\n-->\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![example of (componet_name) keyboard interaction](images/component_name-accessibility-1.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  The (component_name) is reached by Tab and activated by Enter.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<!--\nThe Design recommendations section should only be included if annotations are needed\n-->\n\n## Design recommendations\n\nDesign annotations are needed for the following instances.\n\n<!--\nSome of the possible subheadings here include:\n- headings\n- alignment\n- labeling\n- meaningful order\n\nEach should have a level 3 heading, a descriptive paragraph and a supporting image.\n\nExample:\n\n### Headings\nCarbon accordions are not set as headings by default. For improved accessibility, annotate accordions as headings on the first occurrence in a product. Annotate the heading level of accordions as needed.\n\n-->\n\n## Development considerations\n\nKeep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a\ncustom component.\n\n<!--\nProvide a bulleted list of implementation considerations for ensuring accessibility. If there is the ability to refernce the IBM toolkit or the ARIA authoring practices, that should be done.\n\n- Use dashed bullets and ensure code is styled as code and consistently appears with the\nfollowing symbols: <element>, 'variable' and \"value\".\n- End each bulleted list item with a period.\n\nExample:\n- See the [ARIA authoring practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#tooltip) for more considerations.\n\n-->\n```\n\n## Parts of a component contribution\n\nComponent contributions ideally include all of the following parts.\n\n#### 1. A rationale\n\nExplain how your component will add value to the system. Carbon serves the\nwidest possible range of products, and contributions that increase the scope of\nthe system are more likely to be accepted. Be sure to include any user\nexperience and interaction descriptions.\n\n#### 2. A design spec\n\nCreate sizing and styling annotations for all aspects of the component. This\nspec should provide a developer with everything they need to create the design\nin code. Check out our\n[production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines)\nto get started.\n\nYou should include color tokens and type tokens used.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a design spec](images/content-switcher-style-1.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a design spec</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### 3. A Sketch symbol\n\nAny new components or changes to existing components will also live in the\n[Carbon Sketch kit](/designing/kits/sketch) and so we'll need a Sketch symbol.\nCheck out\n[Sketch's guide](https://www.sketch.com/docs/symbols/creating-symbols/) for\ncreating a symbol.\n\nThis symbol can be contributed with the asset or enhancement, but must be added\nto the kit by one of its maintainers. To contribute a symbol, simply open an\nissue in the\n[kit repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/issues).\n\n#### 4. Usage documentation\n\nFor guidance, see our\n[production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines)\nand [documentation templates](#documentation-templates) above. Reading through\nexisting component documentation on the site will help also. Color and type\ntokens will live in the style tab.\n\n#### 5. Working code\n\nThe component or enhancement must be built in one of our supported frameworks\n(Vanilla, React, Vue, or Angular). See the contribution guidelines for the\nspecific repo you intend to contribute to.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Contribute to Carbon Components React\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/v10/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md\"\n      >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Contribute to Carbon Components Angular\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular/blob/master/README.md#contributing\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Contribute to Carbon Components Vue\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md\"\n      >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### 6. Accessibility documentation\n\nUse this\n[component accessibility documentation](https://github.com/hiraaeth/component-contribution-accessibility/wiki/component-accessibility-documentation)\nto document the accessibility considerations to ensure the implemented component\nis usable by assistive technologies.\n\n#### 7. Code documentation\n\nStart with our [Code guidance](#code-guidance) template. We recommend reading\nthrough existing code documentation on this site for inspiration.\n\n## First steps to contributing\n\nTo contribute a component to Carbon, start by\n[opening a Github issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement+%F0%9F%92%A1&template=feature-request-or-enhancement.md&title=).\nInclude a detailed description in which you:\n\n- Explain the rationale\n- Detail the intended behavior\n- Clarify whether it's a variation of an existing component, or a new asset\n- Include mockups of any fidelity (optional)\n- Include any inspirations from other products (optional)\n\nThis issue will be the staging ground for the contribution and an opportunity\nfor the community to weigh in with any suggestions. We encourage you to surface\nwork in progress. Someone in the community may be working on the same component\nand interested in collaborating with you.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"2e60f504c52baf97a42cf2862c09a403","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4807},"frontmatter":{"title":"Components","description":"Component contributions can take several forms.

Some components are more complex\nthan others but you should cover each topic included in these templates.\n\n### Usage template: for components with one variant\n\nThe usage template helps describe when to use a component and how it works. You\ncan see this template in use for components with only one variant:\n[Accordion](/components/accordion/usage) and\n[Checkbox](/components/checkbox/usage).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Component name\ndescription: Explains what the component is in one or two sentences.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n<!-- Explains what the component is in one or two sentences. -->\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Behaviors</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Modifiers</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\n<!--\nInclude a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the component and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure. The header title give the user a high level overview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.*\n-->\n\n### When to use\n\n<!--\nInclude examples for when to use this component and how it addresses the use case / solves a problem for the user.\n\nExample:\n\n*Dropdowns can be used in forms on full pages, in modals, or on side panels. The dropdown component is used to filter or sort contents on a page. It is a stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.*\n-->\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\n<!--\nIf there are two similar components that are used for different use cases, spell that out here and explain which component to use for each use case.\n\nExample:\n\n*It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two or fewer options to choose from. In this case, use a radio button group instead.*\n-->\n\n## Live demo\n\n<!--Include component demo here.-->\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<!--The anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.\n\nSee [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an example.-->\n\n### Sizing (optional)\n\n<!--List out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case. Other topics that may be covered here include considerations around maximum heights, maximum widths, and responsive resizing.\n\nExample:\n\n*There are four responsive modal sizes: xs, small, default, large. Choose a size that works best for the amount of modal content you have. Modals with short messages should use a xs or small modal to avoid long single lines; for complex components, like data table the default or large modal will be more accommodating.*\n-->\n\n### Alignment (optional)\n\n<!--\nConsider the relationship with other items that are the same. How do they sit in groups? What is their juxtaposition. For example:\n\n- Checkbox, radio button—what is their relationship horizontally and vertically?\n- Notifications—how do they stack?\n- Button—what happens when there's more than one?\n\nWe have some alignment content in the Structure section of the Style tab, so consider the relationship between the two tabs and include a cross-reference if necessary.\n\nExample:\n\n*Inside of a modal, body copy, including titles, have a 20% margin-right. However, form inputs and other components expand the full width of a modal window.*\n-->\n\n### Placement\n\n<!--\nDiscuss placement of the component in a broader context, that is:\n\n- alongside other components\n- within the grid\n\nYou may want to include a link here to the Structure section of the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*Accordions can be placed with main page content or placed inside of a container such as a side panel or tile. When placing an accordion on the 2x Grid the indented title aligns to the grid columns and the top and bottom borders hang in the gutter.*\n-->\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n<!--\nIdentify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, links. Use H4s for the element names and provide guidelines underneath for each element.\n\nBriefly explain any particular rules such as phrase structure, word limits, and character limits. Where there's more than one rule, use bullets to list out the multiple rules for ease of reading. If necessary, refer out to main content guidelines for more detailed information, for example, capitalization, or recommended action labels.\n\nSee [Checkbox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/usage#content) and [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#content) for examples.\n-->\n\n### Overflow content\n\n<!--\nExplain how overflow content should be handled.\n\nExample:\n\n*When the accordion content is longer than the viewport the whole accordion should vertically scroll. Content should not scroll inside of an individual panel. Content should never scroll horizontally in an accordion.*\n-->\n\n### Further guidance\n\n<!--\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's [content guidelines]([https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)).\n-->\n\n## Behaviors\n\n<!--\nDetermine which component behaviors apply to your component, and include from the following sections as needed.\n-->\n\n### States\n\n<!--\nIf including any information on this topic, include the following line:\n\nFor detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component has two main states: collapsed and expanded. The chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.*\n-->\n\n### Interactions\n\n<!--\nInclude all possible interactions with the component, including:\n\n- Mouse\n- Keyboard\n- Screen readers\n\nSee [Accordion](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage#interactions) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Validation\n\n<!--\nInclude any guidelines for data validation and accompanying messaging. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#validation-and-errors) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Responsive behavior\n\n<!--\nInclude details about how the component should behave in responsive situations.\n-->\n\n### Default selection\n\n<!--\nCover guidance around default settings and provide rationale. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#default-values) and [Radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/usage/#default-selection) for examples.\n-->\n\n### Clickable areas\n\n<!--\nProvide details about the clickable areas of the component.\n-->\n\n### Loading\n\n<!--\nIf applicable, use this section to cross reference to the specific loading type in the [Loading component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern) and/or the [Loading pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern/).\n-->\n\n## Modifiers\n\n<!--\nThe modifiers section shows different ways of styling the component. Here are some examples:\n\n- adding an icon to a [button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#variations)\n- adding a button to a [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#anatomy)\n- styling a dropdown to appear inline with other content\n- using high and low contrast styles for [notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)\n- using a \"light\" variant in a [text input](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/code)\n-->\n\n## Related\n\n<!--\nDid you reference other components or patterns? List them here.\n\nIf necessary, clarify any differences between this component and related components.\n-->\n\n## References\n\n<!--\nInclude any research, citations, books or articles that you found helpful.\n-->\n\n## Feedback\n\n<!--Include a request for feedback here.-->\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n### Usage template: for components with multiple variants\n\nUse this template for documenting components that have multiple types or\nvariants.

The native select works more easily with a native form when submitting data and is also easier to use on a mobile platform.*\n-->\n\n### Types\n\n<!--\nTypes are different variations of the component with significant visual or interaction differences, for example, primary button vs. secondary button vs. ghost button. Minor visual differences, such as button height, should be placed under modifiers.\n\nInclude a table with types of components and their purpose. Include links on the type names to the types sections below. See [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#passive-modal) for an example.\n-->\n\n## Live demo\n\n<!--\nInclude live demo here.\n-->\n\n## Formatting\n\n<!--\n### Anatomy\n\nThe anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements.

Begin the table with the State column, not the Element column; this helps users scan faster and better reference accompanying images, which are also organized by state. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.\n\nYou may also choose to include images or tabs to illustrate variants.\n\nThe following table shows an example from [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style).\n-->\n\n| State    | Element | Property   | Color token        |\n| -------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------ |\n| Hover    | Header  | background | `$layer-hover`\\*   |\n| Focus    | Header  | border     | `$focus`           |\n| Disabled | Header  | border-top | `$border-subtle`\\* |\n|          | Title   | background | `$text-disabled`   |\n|          | Icon    | fill       | `$icon-disabled`   |\n\n<Caption>\n  * Denotes a contextual color token that will change values based on the layer\n  it is placed on.\n</Caption>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Default\">\n\n![default accordion alignment interactive states](images/accordion-style-2.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Flush\">\n\n![flush accordion alignment interactive states](images/accordion-style-3.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Typography\n\n<!--\nBegin this section with any brief content guidelines. Link out to additional guidelines if needed.\n\nThen, use a table to document font-size, font-weight, and type tokens in this section.

See the accordion\n[content guidelines](/components/accordion/usage#content) for more details.\n\n| Element | Font-size (px/rem) | Font-weight   | Type token |\n| ------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ---------- |\n| Title   | 14 / 0.875         | Regular / 400 | `$body-01` |\n| Content | 14 / 0.875         | Regular / 400 | `$body-01` |\n\n## Structure\n\n<!--\nBegin the structure section with a table to document states, spacing, and any other component-specific configurations. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.\n\nAdd supporting images to this section, with at least one image showing structure and another showing spacing measurements. Images should be accompanied by a descriptive caption and relate to the spec charts. Note we use the `image--fixed` markdown component in the Structure section to maintain size accuracy.\n\nVariants: You may need to provide additional specs for component variants like default versus flush alignment. For each variant, make a new h3 section and give it a name. The following are example pairs of section headers:\n\nDefault style text area structure\nFluid style text area structure\n\nDefault style text input structure\nFluid style text input structure\n\nDefault alignment structure\nFlush alignment structure\n\nModifiers: If you need to document additional ways of styling a component, add h3 sections under Structure as needed. Here are some example cases where a modifier section has been added:\n\n- adding an icon to a [button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#variations)\n- adding a button to a [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#anatomy)\n- using high and low contrast styles for [notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)\n\nThe following content shows example documentation from [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style), which has no variants and therefore does not need any h3 headers.\n-->\n\n| Element | Property    | px/rem   | Spacing token |\n| ------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |\n| Header  | height      | 40 / 2.5 | –             |\n| Item    | border-top  | 1        | –             |\n| Title   | margin-left | 16 / 1   | `$spacing-05` |\n\n<div className=\"image--fixed\">\n\n![Structure measurements for default accordion alignment](images/accordion-style-4.png)\n\n</div>\n\n<Caption>\n  Structure measurements for default accordion alignment. | px / rem\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n<div className=\"image--fixed\">\n\n![Spacing measurements for default accordion alignment](images/accordion-style-5.png)\n\n</div>\n\n<Caption>\n  Spacing measurements for default accordion alignment. | px / rem\n</Caption>\n\n## Size\n\n<!--\nIn the size section, provide a table of component size names and height. Be sure to cross-link this to the size section in the usage tab, which is where you should provide guidance about how to choose the best size for a given use case.\n\nExample: The following table shows an example from [Button](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/style).\n-->\n\nThere are six button sizes: small, medium, large productive, large expressive,\nextra large, and 2XL. The large expressive button is used in editorial and\ndigital marketing experiences. See\n[Button sizes](/components/button/usage#button-sizes) on the Usage tab for more\ninformation about specific use cases for each button size.\n\n| Variant           | Size             | Height (px / rem) |\n| ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |\n| Button            | Small            | 32 / 2            |\n|                   | Medium           | 40 / 2.5          |\n|                   | Large productive | 48 / 3            |\n|                   | Large expressive | 48 / 3            |\n| Full bleed button | Extra large      | 64 / 4            |\n|                   | 2xl              | 80 / 5            |\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Button sizes](images/button_usage_3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Feedback\n\n<!--Include a request for feedback here.-->\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n### Code template\n\nThe code template helps developers implement your component. Be specific,\ninclude code snippets, and be sure to update as dependencies and versions\nchange.\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Component name (you won't need to write this)\ndescription: Component description (you won't need to write this)\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n<!-- How to build a [component name] using React.

The Breadcrumb component accepts a list of BreadcrumbItem components as children and each BreadcrumbItem is responsible for displaying the page links in the hierarchy.\n-->\n\n### Skeleton\n\n<!--\nInclude which component/s to use for the skeleton state and why it might be useful.\n\nExample:\n\n*You can use the BreadcrumbSkeleton component to render a skeleton variant of an breadcrumb.

For example,\nif an accordion had a skeleton then you would name this section Skeleton.\n\nIf the component had a specific piece of functionality or behavior, like\nhow you can sort with a Data Table, then Sorting would be the name of this\nsection.\n\nThis section should include an explainer for the use-case and when to use it,\nalong with a code snippet that someone could bring into their project.\n-->\n\n## Component API\n\n### [Component name] props\n\n| Prop        | Type     | Required | Default | Description |\n| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| `className` | `string` | –        | –       | –           |\n\n<!--\n* Only specific required as `true`, if it's false you don't need to indicate that\n* Specify the default value if applicable\n* Provide a description if applicable\n* Annotate the type using TypeScript type annotations\n* Empty cells should be filled with en dashes (–)\n* Table should be sorted in alphabetical order\n-->\n\n#### [Component name][prop name]\n\n<!--\nUsed to clarify prop usage, provide additional info or snippets\n-->\n\n## References\n\n<!--\nA place for references, links, or a way clarify points made earlier\nin the documentation.\n-->\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n### Accessibility template\n\nThe accessibility template helps designers and developers ensure components are\naccessible. The published information helps users understand all the\naccessibility considerations that are baked into Carbon. Refer to our guidance\non creating the\n[keyboard interaction visuals](https://github.com/hiraaeth/component-contribution-accessibility/wiki/High-fidelity-keyboard-interaction-visuals).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Component name (you won't need to write this)\ndescription: Component description (you won't need to write this)\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n<!--\nThere are 2 stock page descriptions.\nChoose the first example if designers need to include annotations in their wireframes to make the component accessible. Choose the second if the component is accessible without additional design decisions.\n** If example 2 is used, the Design recommendations section and its anchor link should be removed.\n\nExample 1:\nDesign annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the\nstandard [component_name] component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.\n\nExample 2:\nNo accessibility annotations are needed for [component_name]s, but keep these considerations in\nmind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom component.\n-->\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>What Carbon provides</AnchorLink>\n  <!--\n  Only include Design recommendations if there are actually tasks for a designer to do\n  -->\n  <AnchorLink>Design recommendations</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Development considerations</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## What Carbon provides\n\nCarbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of\nblind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many\nother accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.\n\n### Keyboard interaction\n\n<!--\nThis keyboard section introduction text can give details of keyboard operation. For actionable components, begin by talking about the navigation via the tab stop, then discuss common interactions keys. For components with subcomponents, unless there is little interaction for the subcomponent, consider splitting the subcomponent considerations into a separate paragraph, separated by an illustration. Where operation is more complicated, separate headings for Keyboard navigation and Keyboard interaction can exist.Keyboard keys should be referred to with code styling.\n\nExample 1:\n-->\n\nEach accordion is a tab stop. `Space` or `Enter` keys expand or collapse\naccordions, which are collapsed by default. Interactive elements within expanded\naccordions integrate into the tab order automatically.\n\n<!--\nExample 2:\nEach page link in the breadcrumb is reached by `Tab` and activated by `Enter`. The current\npage, if listed in the breadcrumb, is not a link. If the breadcrumb is truncated, the ellipsis button\nfor the overflow menu is in the tab order. See [overflow menu]((https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/overflow-menu/usage/)) for details on its keyboard operation\n-->\n\n<!--\n**Images**\nUse one image to document keyboard navigation. If the component has limited operation functionality, it may also be incorporated in the same image. Otherwise, the operation should be dealt with in a separate image.\nNormally these images go across 8 columns.\nimages should follow the naming convention (component_name-accessibility-1.png\nThe ALT text text for the first image can be fairly generic, since the image is just restating information in the prior paragraph.\nThe caption should likewise summarize something already described in the preceding paragraph. No new information should be given in the caption. Due to technology constraints, keystroke names in the captions are not given any markdown styling.\nExample:\n![example of breadcrumb keyboard interaction](images/breadcrumb-accessibility-1.png)\n<Caption>\n  The breadcrumb's links are reached by Tab and activated by Enter.\n</Caption>\n-->\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![example of (componet_name) keyboard interaction](images/component_name-accessibility-1.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  The (component_name) is reached by Tab and activated by Enter.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<!--\nThe Design recommendations section should only be included if annotations are needed\n-->\n\n## Design recommendations\n\nDesign annotations are needed for the following instances.\n\n<!--\nSome of the possible subheadings here include:\n- headings\n- alignment\n- labeling\n- meaningful order\n\nEach should have a level 3 heading, a descriptive paragraph and a supporting image.\n\nExample:\n\n### Headings\nCarbon accordions are not set as headings by default. For improved accessibility, annotate accordions as headings on the first occurrence in a product. Annotate the heading level of accordions as needed.\n\n-->\n\n## Development considerations\n\nKeep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a\ncustom component.\n\n<!--\nProvide a bulleted list of implementation considerations for ensuring accessibility. If there is the ability to refernce the IBM toolkit or the ARIA authoring practices, that should be done.\n\n- Use dashed bullets and ensure code is styled as code and consistently appears with the\nfollowing symbols: <element>, 'variable' and \"value\".\n- End each bulleted list item with a period.\n\nExample:\n- See the [ARIA authoring practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#tooltip) for more considerations.\n\n-->\n```\n\n## Parts of a component contribution\n\nComponent contributions ideally include all of the following parts.\n\n#### 1. A rationale\n\nExplain how your component will add value to the system. Carbon serves the\nwidest possible range of products, and contributions that increase the scope of\nthe system are more likely to be accepted. Be sure to include any user\nexperience and interaction descriptions.\n\n#### 2. A design spec\n\nCreate sizing and styling annotations for all aspects of the component. This\nspec should provide a developer with everything they need to create the design\nin code. Check out our\n[production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines)\nto get started.\n\nYou should include color tokens and type tokens used.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a design spec](images/content-switcher-style-1.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a design spec</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### 3. A Sketch symbol\n\nAny new components or changes to existing components will also live in the\n[Carbon Sketch kit](/designing/kits/sketch) and so we'll need a Sketch symbol.\nCheck out\n[Sketch's guide](https://www.sketch.com/docs/symbols/creating-symbols/) for\ncreating a symbol.\n\nThis symbol can be contributed with the asset or enhancement, but must be added\nto the kit by one of its maintainers. To contribute a symbol, simply open an\nissue in the\n[kit repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/issues).\n\n#### 4. Usage documentation\n\nFor guidance, see our\n[production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines)\nand [documentation templates](#documentation-templates) above. Reading through\nexisting component documentation on the site will help also. Color and type\ntokens will live in the style tab.\n\n#### 5. Working code\n\nThe component or enhancement must be built in one of our supported frameworks\n(Vanilla, React, Vue, or Angular). See the contribution guidelines for the\nspecific repo you intend to contribute to.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Contribute to Carbon Components React\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/v10/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md\"\n      >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Contribute to Carbon Components Angular\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular/blob/master/README.md#contributing\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Contribute to Carbon Components Vue\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md\"\n      >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### 6. Accessibility documentation\n\nUse this\n[component accessibility documentation](https://github.com/hiraaeth/component-contribution-accessibility/wiki/component-accessibility-documentation)\nto document the accessibility considerations to ensure the implemented component\nis usable by assistive technologies.\n\n#### 7. Code documentation\n\nStart with our [Code guidance](#code-guidance) template. We recommend reading\nthrough existing code documentation on this site for inspiration.\n\n## First steps to contributing\n\nTo contribute a component to Carbon, start by\n[opening a Github issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement+%F0%9F%92%A1&template=feature-request-or-enhancement.md&title=).\nInclude a detailed description in which you:\n\n- Explain the rationale\n- Detail the intended behavior\n- Clarify whether it's a variation of an existing component, or a new asset\n- Include mockups of any fidelity (optional)\n- Include any inspirations from other products (optional)\n\nThis issue will be the staging ground for the contribution and an opportunity\nfor the community to weigh in with any suggestions. We encourage you to surface\nwork in progress. Someone in the community may be working on the same component\nand interested in collaborating with you.\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/carbon-website/carbon-website/src/pages/contributing/component/index.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","3018647132","3037994772","768070550"]}
