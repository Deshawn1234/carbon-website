Designers are often responsible for researching UX and visual\nsolutions and then creating a design spec for developers.\n[Here are issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22proposal%3A+accepted%22+label%3A%22community+contribution%22+label%3A%22type%3A+enhancement+%F0%9F%92%A1%22+)\nin our enhancement backlog that need design or development work.\n\n### Design kits\n\nThis work is all about creating and updating reusable components is Figma.\nYou'll get valuable Figma experience and will collaborate with the Figma Guild.\nCheck out the\n[status of design kits](https://www.figma.com/file/CFMtqV5Nztdbm0mi2UiDLg/Library-%2B-Template-Planning?type=design&node-id=3713-26762&mode=design&t=HqvAYXUeccKNMstT-0)\nand get involved by reaching out to the contacts listed.\n\n### Website documentation\n\nAll components and patterns require usage, style, code, and accessibility\nguidance on the Carbon website. You can learn how to contribute documentation\nsmoothly and utilize our markdown templates on the\n[documentation](/contributing/documentation/) page. A list of components that\nstill need documentation help can be found\n[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/2085).\n\n### Fixing issues and bugs\n\nIf you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by\n[filling out a bug report](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\nand, ideally, submitting a pull request with a fix.\n\n### Icons and pictograms\n\nYou can find instructions on how to create and contribute\n[UI icons](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/ui-icons/contribute),\n[app icons](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/app-icons/production),\nand\n[pictograms](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/pictograms/contribute)\non the IBM Design Language site.\n\n## The process\n\nWhether you're contributing code, designs, or documentation, there's a process\nto follow. Here's what it looks like:\n\n### 1. Find a project to work on\n\n#### Volunteer for existing work\n\nThe best way to volunteer is to look through\n[existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community+contribution%22)\nlabeled with `community contribution`. You can also filter by\n[developer](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community+contribution%22++label%3A%22role%3A+dev+%F0%9F%A4%96%22_)\nor\n[designer](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community+contribution%22++label%3A%22role%3A+design+%3Apencil2%3A%22+)\nroles. Put a comment in the issue saying you'd like to help.\n\nThe Carbon team is also happy to help you find a good first issue. Just stop by\nour [office hours](/whats-happening/meetups/) or send us a slack message.\n\n#### Submit an idea\n\nHave a new idea that you think would benefit Carbon? Or do you need to report a\nbug? First, be sure to look through the\n[issue backlog](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) to make\nsure it is a novel idea or bug. Then, file your proposal on GitHub using the\n[issue templates](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose).\nIf you're willing to work on this idea yourself, be sure to let is know in your\nissue! Your idea will then go through a triage process by the Carbon team.\n\n### 2. Iterate and get feedback\n\nMost contributors work in groups of 2-3 and either set up weekly sessions or\njoin [meetups](/whats-happening/meetups/#carbon-office-hours) such as the Figma\nGuild, Data Viz Guild, or office hours. In these sessions, it is common to share\nwork in progress and ask lots of questions. As you make progress, update your\nGitHub issue.\n\n### 3. Review and publish\n\n#### Code deliverables\n\nWork that results in code will be reviewed directly in a pull request.\nMaintainers will be reviewing your work and making comments, asking questions\nand suggesting changes to be made before they merge your code. When you need to\nmake a change, commit and push to your branch normally. Once all revisions to\nyour pull request are complete, a maintainer will squash and merge your commits\nfor you.\n\n#### Contributor License Agreement\n\nThe Carbon core team is part of IBM. To accept contributions, we need a signed\nContributor License Agreement (CLA) from you before code contributions can be\nreviewed and merged. You will be prompted to do this in your PR, but if you have\nquestions, please don't hesitate\ntoÂ [reach out](/help/contact-us/#slack-channels).\n\n#### Design deliverables\n\nFor work that does not have a code deliverable, such as revisions to Figma\nlibraries, ask the Carbon team how to finish your contribution.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"500c2af32704c770f160b6293b7b9630","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4415},"frontmatter":{"title":"Get started","description":"The Carbon Design System is made possible through a vibrant community of designers and developers.
