All\nthree tools are supported by Carbon for the foreseeable future with Figma having\npriority over Sketch and Adobe XD for support and maintenance. The design kits\nare also available in both the latest versions of Carbon with support for v11\nprioritized over v10.\n\nThese primary kits include all the Carbon core components and styles for your\nreuse in your product and web experiences to create Carbon compliant designs. By\nusing the kits you will automatically receive updates made to the Carbon\nlibraries ensuring your designs stay up to date with the latest release as well\nas ensuring consistency between design assets and code.\n\nHead on over to the [Design kits](/designing/kits/sketch) section and follow the\ninstall instructions to get set up.\n\n| Design tool  | Carbon version                                                    | Status                        | Maintainer          |\n| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |\n| **Figma**    | [v11](https://carbondesignsystem.com/designing/kits/figma)        | Available                     | Carbon Figma Guild  |\n|              | [v10](https://v10.carbondesignsystem.com/designing/kits/figma)    | Available – _limited support_ | Carbon Figma Guild  |\n| **Sketch**   | [v11](https://carbondesignsystem.com/designing/kits/sketch)       | Available                     | Carbon Sketch Guild |\n|              | [v10](https://v10.carbondesignsystem.com/designing/kits/sketch)   | Available – _limited support_ | Carbon core team    |\n| **Adobe XD** | [v11](https://carbondesignsystem.com/designing/kits/adobe-xd)     | Available                     | Carbon core team    |\n|              | [v10](https://v10.carbondesignsystem.com/designing/kits/adobe-xd) | Available – _limited support_ | Carbon core team    |\n\n### Additional design assets\n\nIn [Other resources](/designing/design-resources/), you’ll find links to icon\nlibraries, color palettes, grid and shell templates, the IBM Plex font, and the\nGithub repos. As well as additional kits for mid-fidelity wireframing and\nprototyping tools like Invision Freehand and Axure.\n\n## Learn about foundational guidance\n\nCarbon expresses the IBM Design Language in product and delivers it through\ntools for designers and developers including guidance, tooling, components, and\nsupport. Learn what drives IBM’s design philosophy and principles so that you\ncan make informed decisions in your product work.\n\nThe IBM brand systems have been developed for various IBM businesses, audiences,\ncategories, and offerings. Read them to understand the rationale behind every\nvisual and verbal detail to ensure your work is built on these important\nfoundations. _This content is accessible to IBMers only._\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"IBM Design Language\"\n    href=\"https://www.ibm.com/design/language/\"\n    >\n\n![Bee icon](/images/bee.svg)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"IBM Brand Systems\"\n    href=\"https://www.ibm.com/brand/systems\"\n    >\n\n![Bee icon](images/bee.svg)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Review our usage guidance\n\nOur usage guidance is detailed and thorough, and you'll learn a lot about the\nsystem by reading through the components and patterns documentation.\n\n- [Components](/components/overview): Carbon provides in-depth design usage and\n  style guidance for all components. It's important to be familiar with this\n  additional UX and visual guidance when you are designing with our components.\n\n- [Patterns](/patterns/overview): We also offer a range of key patterns—best\n  practice solutions for how a user achieves a goal. These design patterns have\n  been harvested from products built with Carbon, and have been reviewed and\n  approved for use by the Carbon governance team.\n\n## Connect with us\n\n### Join us and the Carbon community\n\n_For IBMers only:_ If you have a question about any aspect of the kits or tools,\nyou can reach out to us on Slack and use that as a way to connect with your\nfellow designers.
