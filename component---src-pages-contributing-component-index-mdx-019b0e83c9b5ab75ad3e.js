The header title give the user a high level overview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.*\n--\x3e\n\n### When to use\n\n\x3c!--\nInclude examples for when to use this component and how it addresses the use case / solves a problem for the user.\n\nExample:\n\n*Dropdowns can be used in forms on full pages, in modals, or on side panels. The dropdown component is used to filter or sort contents on a page. It is a stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.*\n--\x3e\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\n\x3c!--\nIf there are two similar components that are used for different use cases, spell that out here and explain which component to use for each use case.\n\nExample:\n\n*It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two or fewer options to choose from. In this case, use a radio button group instead.*\n--\x3e\n\n## Live demo\n\n\x3c!--Include component demo here.--\x3e\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\n\x3c!--The anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.\n\nSee [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an example.--\x3e\n\n### Sizing (optional)\n\n\x3c!--List out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case. Other topics that may be covered here include considerations around maximum heights, maximum widths, and responsive resizing.\n\nExample:\n\n*There are four responsive modal sizes: xs, small, default, large. Choose a size that works best for the amount of modal content you have. Modals with short messages should use a xs or small modal to avoid long single lines; for complex components, like data table the default or large modal will be more accommodating.*\n--\x3e\n\n### Alignment (optional)\n\n\x3c!--\nConsider the relationship with other items that are the same. How do they sit in groups? What is their juxtaposition. For example:\n\n- Checkbox, radio button—what is their relationship horizontally and vertically?\n- Notifications—how do they stack?\n- Button—what happens when there's more than one?\n\nWe have some alignment content in the Structure section of the Style tab, so consider the relationship between the two tabs and include a cross-reference if necessary.\n\nExample:\n\n*Inside of a modal, body copy, including titles, have a 20% margin-right. However, form inputs and other components expand the full width of a modal window.*\n--\x3e\n\n### Placement\n\n\x3c!--\nDiscuss placement of the component in a broader context, that is:\n\n- alongside other components\n- within the grid\n\nYou may want to include a link here to the Structure section of the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*Accordions can be placed with main page content or placed inside of a container such as a side panel or tile. When placing an accordion on the 2x Grid the indented title aligns to the grid columns and the top and bottom borders hang in the gutter.*\n--\x3e\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n\x3c!--\nIdentify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, links. Use H4s for the element names and provide guidelines underneath for each element.\n\nBriefly explain any particular rules such as phrase structure, word limits, and character limits. Where there's more than one rule, use bullets to list out the multiple rules for ease of reading. If necessary, refer out to main content guidelines for more detailed information, for example, capitalization, or recommended action labels.\n\nSee [Checkbox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/usage#content) and [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#content) for examples.\n--\x3e\n\n### Overflow content\n\n\x3c!--\nExplain how overflow content should be handled.\n\nExample:\n\n*When the accordion content is longer than the viewport the whole accordion should vertically scroll. Content should not scroll inside of an individual panel. Content should never scroll horizontally in an accordion.*\n--\x3e\n\n### Further guidance\n\n\x3c!--\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's [content guidelines]([https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)).\n--\x3e\n\n## Behaviors\n\n\x3c!--\nDetermine which component behaviors apply to your component, and include from the following sections as needed.\n--\x3e\n\n### States\n\n\x3c!--\nIf including any information on this topic, include the following line:\n\nFor detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component has two main states: collapsed and expanded. The chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.*\n--\x3e\n\n### Interactions\n\n\x3c!--\nInclude all possible interactions with the component, including:\n\n- Mouse\n- Keyboard\n- Screen readers\n\nSee [Accordion](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage#interactions) for an example.\n--\x3e\n\n### Validation\n\n\x3c!--\nInclude any guidelines for data validation and accompanying messaging. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#validation-and-errors) for an example.\n--\x3e\n\n### Responsive behavior\n\n\x3c!--\nInclude details about how the component should behave in responsive situations.\n--\x3e\n\n### Default selection\n\n\x3c!--\nCover guidance around default settings and provide rationale. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#default-values) and [Radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/usage/#default-selection) for examples.\n--\x3e\n\n### Clickable areas\n\n\x3c!--\nProvide details about the clickable areas of the component.\n--\x3e\n\n### Loading\n\n\x3c!--\nIf applicable, use this section to cross reference to the specific loading type in the [Loading component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern) and/or the [Loading pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern/).\n--\x3e\n\n## Modifiers\n\n\x3c!--\nThe modifiers section shows different ways of styling the component. Here are some examples:\n\n- adding an icon to a [button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#variations)\n- adding a button to a [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#anatomy)\n- styling a dropdown to appear inline with other content\n- using high and low contrast styles for [notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)\n- using a \"light\" variant in a [text input](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/code)\n--\x3e\n\n## Related\n\n\x3c!--\nDid you reference other components or patterns?

The native select works more easily with a native form when submitting data and is also easier to use on a mobile platform.*\n--\x3e\n\n### Types\n\n\x3c!--\nTypes are different variations of the component with significant visual or interaction differences, for example, primary button vs. secondary button vs. ghost button. Minor visual differences, such as button height, should be placed under modifiers.\n\nInclude a table with types of components and their purpose. Include links on the type names to the types sections below.

Forms can be placed on a full page, in a modal or in a side panel. A checkbox can also be used for agreeing to terms and conditions or to filter information.*\n--\x3e\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n\x3c!--\nIdentify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, body copy, links. Use H4s for the element names and provide guidelines underneath for each element.\n\nBriefly explain any particular rules such as phrase structure, word limits, and character limits.

The content should visibly fade at the end of the modal body area to indicate there is additional content out of view.*\n--\x3e\n\n### Further guidance\n\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's\n[content guidelines](<[https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)>).\n\n## Universal behaviors\n\n\x3c!--\nIf there are any *universal* behaviors that apply to all types listed in the types table above, include them here. For example, the Modal component has a heading here for \"Trap focus\" as this applies to all modal types.\n\nWhere behaviors are *unique* to each type of component, include them in the next section which goes into detail about each type.\n\nInclude the following line to introduce the universal behaviors:\n\nExample:\n\n*The behaviors listed in this section are universal across all of the types. For behaviors that are unique to each type, see each of the component type sections below.*\n\nChoose from this list of possible behaviors that are *universal* across all types, and include them here as H3 headings.\n--\x3e\n\n### States\n\n\x3c!--\nIf including any information on this topic, include the following line:\n\nFor detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component has two main states: collapsed and expanded. The chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.*\n--\x3e\n\n### Interactions\n\n\x3c!--\nInclude all possible interactions with the component, including:\n\n- Mouse\n- Keyboard\n- Screen readers\n\nSee [Accordion](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage#interactions) for an example.\n--\x3e\n\n### Validation\n\n\x3c!--\nInclude any guidelines for data validation and accompanying messaging.

For example,\nif an accordion had a skeleton then you would name this section Skeleton.\n\nIf the component had a specific piece of functionality or behavior, like\nhow you can sort with a Data Table, then Sorting would be the name of this\nsection.\n\nThis section should include an explainer for the use-case and when to use it,\nalong with a code snippet that someone could bring into their project.\n--\x3e\n\n## Component API\n\n### [Component name] props\n\n| Prop        | Type     | Required | Default | Description |\n| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| `className` | `string` | –        | –       | –           |\n\n\x3c!--\n* Only specific required as `true`, if it's false you don't need to indicate that\n* Specify the default value if applicable\n* Provide a description if applicable\n* Annotate the type using TypeScript type annotations\n* Empty cells should be filled with en dashes (–)\n* Table should be sorted in alphabetical order\n--\x3e\n\n#### [Component name][prop name]\n\n\x3c!--\nUsed to clarify prop usage, provide additional info or snippets\n--\x3e\n\n## References\n\n\x3c!--\nA place for references, links, or a way clarify points made earlier\nin the documentation.\n--\x3e\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n")),(0,a.kt)("h2",null,"Parts of a component contribution"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Component contributions ideally include all of the following parts."),(0,a.kt)("h4",null,"1.
